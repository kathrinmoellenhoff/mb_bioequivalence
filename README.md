# mb_bioequivalence
This repository contains code corresponding to the manuscript "Efficient model-based bioequivalence Testing".

The R-file "be_nlmem_parallel.R" contains code to apply the two model-based approaches, that is the new optimal procedure, and the model-based TOST, to two examplatory datasets, namely dataset_1.txt and dataset_2.txt. These datasets have been generated usind a parallel design and assuming H_0 and H_1, respectively. For a more detailed description see the comments in the code.
As the version for cross-over designs requires additionally to R the software Monolix, it is not uploaded here, but can be sent upon request.
